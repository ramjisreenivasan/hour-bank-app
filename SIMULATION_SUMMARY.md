# HourBank Transaction History Simulation

## Overview
This simulation creates a realistic transaction history for the HourBank application, assuming it has been fully functional since June 1, 2025. The simulation generates authentic user interactions, service exchanges, and hour-based transactions.

## Simulation Results

### üìä Key Statistics
- **Users**: 10 diverse users with different skills
- **Services**: 10 services across various categories
- **Transactions**: 76 completed transactions
- **Bookings**: 67 scheduled service bookings
- **Total Hours Exchanged**: 138 hours
