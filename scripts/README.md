#### Error Handling

The script handles various error scenarios:

- **User Not Found**: Exits gracefully if the target user doesn't exist
- **GraphQL Errors**: Reports detailed GraphQL error messages
- **Network Issues**: Handles connection and timeout errors
- **Validation Errors**: Reports field validation issues

#### Customization

To add different services, modify the `sampleServices` array in the script:

```javascript
const sampleServices = [
  {
    title: "Your Service Title",
    description: "Detailed description of your service...",
    category: "Technology", // or Education, Creative, etc.
    hourlyRate: 5, // in bank hours
    isActive: true,
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
  }
  // ... more services
];
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. **"User not found"**: Verify the user ID exists in DynamoDB
2. **"GraphQL errors"**: Check Amplify configuration and API permissions
3. **"Module not found"**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. **"Permission denied"**: Ensure the script has execute permissions

## Contributing

When adding new utility scripts:

1. Follow the same error handling patterns
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Update this README with usage instructions
4. Add npm script entries in `package.json`
