# hOurBank Logo Integration

## Overview
The hOurBank application now uses the professional `hb-logo-v1.png` logo throughout the application, replacing the previous SVG placeholder.

- **Size**: 253.45 KB
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Design**: Classical bank building with hourglass symbolizing time-based currency

- Multiple size declarations for better browser support
- Apple touch icon support for mobile devices

### 4. Page Title

```

## Browser Support
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- High-DPI display optimization
- Fallback favicon for older browsers

## Performance Considerations
- Logo file is optimized at 253KB
- Cached by browser after first load
- No external dependencies
- Lazy loading not needed due to above-the-fold placement

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Create multiple logo sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64) for optimal loading
- [ ] Add dark mode variant of the logo
- [ ] Create animated version for loading states
- [ ] Add logo to email templates and documentation

## Verification
Run the verification script to check integration:
```bash
node verify-logo-integration.js
```

## Testing
1. Start development server: `ng serve`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
3. Verify logo appears in navigation
4. Check browser tab for favicon
5. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
6. Verify hover effects work properly

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing
- Check that `public/hb-logo-v1.png` exists
- Verify Angular is serving static files from `public/`
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Favicon Not Updating
- Clear browser cache completely
- Check browser developer tools for 404 errors
- Verify file path in `index.html`

### Styling Issues
- Check CSS custom properties are defined
- Verify component styles are not being overridden
- Test in different browsers for consistency

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure `public/hb-logo-v1.png` is included in build output
- Verify logo loads correctly on production domain
- Test favicon on various devices and browsers
- Monitor logo loading performance in production
