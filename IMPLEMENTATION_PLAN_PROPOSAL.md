## Technical Implementation Details

### Required New DynamoDB Tables
Based on DYNAMODB_TABLES_ANALYSIS.md (reduced set with Step Functions):

1. **ServiceRequest** - Workflow state persistence
2. **Escrow** - Financial transaction state
3. **UserBalance** - Real-time balance management
4. **TransactionLog** - Audit trail
5. **Dispute** - Dispute management
6. **EventLog** - Business event tracking

### Step Functions State Machines
1. **ServiceRequestWorkflow** - Main request processing
2. **EscrowManagementWorkflow** - Financial operations
3. **EscrowCancellationWorkflow** - Refund processing
4. **DisputeResolutionWorkflow** - Dispute handling

### Lambda Functions Architecture
- **Common Layer**: Shared utilities (DynamoDB client, logger, types)
- **Individual Functions**: Single responsibility, well-tested
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error format and retry logic
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for all functions
