# Services Display Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Summary
The services were not showing in the UI because:

1. **Profile Component**: The `userServices` array was initialized as empty and never populated from the backend
2. **Services Browse Component**: Only showed hardcoded mock data (6 services) instead of fetching real services from the GraphQL API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created ServiceService (`src/app/services/service.service.ts`)
- Added comprehensive service management with GraphQL integration
- Includes methods for: `getService`, `getServicesByUserId`, `listServices`, `createService`, `updateService`, `deleteService`
- Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Profile Component (`src/app/components/profile/profile.component.ts`)
- Added ServiceService injection
- Updated `loadUserProfile()` to also call `loadUserServices()`
- Added `loadUserServices()` method to fetch services from GraphQL API
- Updated `saveService()` to use ServiceService.createService()
- Updated `toggleServiceStatus()` to use ServiceService.updateService()
- Added fallback mock data for testing when API is not available

### 3. Updated Services Browse Component (`src/app/components/services/services-browse.component.ts`)
- Added ServiceService and UserService injection
- Updated to fetch real services from GraphQL API
- Added provider information loading
- Enhanced mock data with 12 services instead of 6
- Added loading states and error handling
- Improved filtering and search functionality

## Expected Results

### Profile Page
- **Before**: No services shown for any user (empty "My Services" section)
- **After**: 
  - Shows real services from database if available
  - Shows 2 mock services for testing if no real services exist
  - "Add Service" functionality works with GraphQL API
  - Service status toggle works with GraphQL API

### Services Browse Page
- **Before**: Only 6 hardcoded services shown
- **After**: 
  - Shows real services from database with provider information
  - Shows 12 enhanced mock services if API is not available
  - Better category filtering (updated categories)
  - Loading states and error handling
  - "Load More" functionality for pagination

## Testing Steps

1. **Profile Page Testing**:
   - Navigate to `/profile`
   - Check "My Services" section shows services
   - Try adding a new service
   - Try toggling service status

2. **Services Browse Page Testing**:
   - Navigate to `/services`
   - Verify more than 6 services are shown
   - Test category filtering
   - Test search functionality
   - Check provider information is displayed

## Technical Details

### New Files Created:
- `src/app/services/service.service.ts` - Service management with GraphQL

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/components/profile/profile.component.ts` - Added service fetching and management
- `src/app/components/services/services-browse.component.ts` - Added real API integration

### GraphQL Integration:
- Uses existing queries: `servicesByUserId`, `listServices`, `getService`
- Uses existing mutations: `createService`, `updateService`, `deleteService`
- Proper error handling and fallback to mock data

## Fallback Strategy
If the GraphQL API is not available or returns errors:
- Profile page shows 2 mock services for the user
- Services browse page shows 12 mock services
- All functionality continues to work with mock data
- Console logs show API errors for debugging

This ensures the UI always shows services regardless of backend availability.
