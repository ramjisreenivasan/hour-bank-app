## To Complete the Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "HourBank App"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

2. **Push using the token:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/awsramji/projects/hourbank/hourbank-app
   git push https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/ramjisreenivasan/hour-bank-app.git main
   ```

   Replace:
   - `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with `ramjisreenivasan`
   - `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with the token you just created

### Option 2: Using SSH (Alternative)

1. **Generate SSH key (if you don't have one):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ramjisreenivasan@gmail.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Copy the public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste the key and save

3. **Change remote URL and push:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/awsramji/projects/hourbank/hourbank-app
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ramjisreenivasan/hour-bank-app.git
   git push -u origin main
