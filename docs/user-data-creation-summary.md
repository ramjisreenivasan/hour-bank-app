# User Data Creation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created missing user profiles for existing services in the HourBank application. The system had 41 services but only 2 users, creating orphaned services that referenced non-existent user IDs.

## Problem Identified
- **Total Services**: 41 services in the database
- **Existing Users**: Only 2 users existed
- **Missing Users**: 15 user profiles were missing
- **Data Integrity Issue**: Services referenced user IDs that didn't exist in the User table

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Analyzed existing services to identify referenced user IDs
- Compared service user IDs with actual users in the database
- Identified 15 missing user IDs and 1 incorrect user ID reference

### 2. User Profile Creation
Created 15 realistic user profiles based on the services they offer:
