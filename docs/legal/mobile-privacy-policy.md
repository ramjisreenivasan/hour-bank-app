## Overview

HourBank Mobile Gateway App ("the App") is a lightweight mobile application that serves as a gateway to the HourBank skill exchange platform. This privacy policy explains how we handle information in our mobile application.

## What is the HourBank Mobile Gateway App?

The HourBank Mobile Gateway App is designed to:
- Display publicly available community services and provider information
- Provide basic information about the HourBank platform
- Redirect users to the full web application (hourbank.ramjisreenivasan.com) for account creation, authentication, and transactions

## Information We Do NOT Collect

The mobile app does **NOT** collect, store, or process:
- Personal identification information
- Email addresses or phone numbers
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Cookies or tracking data

- Personal messages or communications

## Information We Display

The app displays publicly available information that service providers have chosen to share:
- Service titles and descriptions

- Provider usernames (anonymized user IDs)
- Service ratings and reviews
- Community activity that providers have made public

This information is:
- Already public on the web platform
- Intended for community sharing
- Does not include personal contact information
- Retrieved from our servers only for display purposes

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage:** The app does not store any user data locally on your device
- **Cache:** Only temporary display data is cached for performance, automatically cleared when the app is closed
- **No Persistent Data:** No user information persists between app sessions

## Third-Party Services

The app uses minimal third-party services:
- **Capacitor Browser Plugin:** Only to open the web application in your default browser
- **No Analytics:** We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, or similar tracking services
- **No Advertising:** No ad networks or advertising SDKs are integrated

## External Links

When you access features requiring authentication (sign-in, dashboard, profile, etc.), the app opens your device's web browser and navigates to hourbank.ramjisreenivasan.com. At that point, the web application's privacy policy applies.

## Permissions

The app requests minimal permissions:
- **Internet Access:** To retrieve and display community service information
- **No Camera, Microphone, or Location:** These permissions are not requested or used

## Children's Privacy

Since the app does not collect any personal information, it is safe for users of all ages. However, the full web platform (accessed through browser links) may have age restrictions as outlined in the web platform's terms of service.

## Data Security

- All data displayed is already public information
- Communication with our servers uses HTTPS encryption
- No sensitive data is transmitted or stored by the mobile app

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by:
